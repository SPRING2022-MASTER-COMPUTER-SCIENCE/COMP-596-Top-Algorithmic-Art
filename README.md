Meeting Time: T 6:00pm ~ 8:40pm Meeting Room: DMF330 Instructor: Paul Kim (p2kim@bridgew.edu) Office Hours: M 9:45am ~ 11:45am, TR 9:45am ~ 10:45am Office Location: DMF347 Textbook: The Nature of Code (Daniel Shiffman). You can access the book for free via its website (The Nature of Code). The book uses the language called Processing, but we will use p5.js instead. Course Description: In this class, you will learn various concepts and algorithms to create art such as drawings and interactive graphics. As the final goal, you will create your art using the materials of the class and present it to the class. The following topics will be covered in this class. • p5.js • Perlin Noise • Drawing with Recursion • Fractal • L-Grammar • Cellular Automata • Genetic Algorithm • Scientific Storytelling Prerequisites: Passion for art(!), Knowledge of lower-level math class (Linear Algebra, Trigonometry), logical thinking, problem-solving skills.
